This project is about creating software that will give users the ability to create, fork, market, and sell music

The UI is aimed to be as simplistic as possible while at the same time providing powerful tools.

The concept of forking was inspired by the fact that GitHub gives users the ability to copy other repositories into their own profiles, while allowing them to edit the copy and contribute to the original project. We aim to apply the same concept to music files.
